in this assignment we implemented a tool called STNC (Stands for Student Network Communication) tool, that has two main functions:

Chat – A chat cmd tool that can send messages over the network, to the same tool, listening on the other side, and get the response, so there will be 2 sides communication. The communication is based of IPv4 TCP protocol.
Network Performance Tool – A network performance tool that checks the internal and external network between two processes (that can be in two different machines). The tool generates a 100MB of random data and sends it to the other side via one of the 8 different protocols:
IPv4 – TCP or UDP (local or remote machine).
IPv6 – TCP or UDP (local or remote machine).
Unix Domain Socket (UDS) – Stream (equivalent to TCP) or Datagram (equivalent to UDP), local machine only.
Memory Mapped File – Share the generated data via memory mapping (local machine only).
Piping – Transfer the generated data via piping (local machine only).


compile the code and run the program:
    cmd->make all

part A:
make a server and client program that can send and recieve messages from each other
    ./chat -s <port>
    ./chat -c <ip> <port>
    to test it on your own computer, open two terminals and run the server on one and the client on the other
    choose a port number between 1024 and 65535
    and ip address 127.0.0.1
part B:
make a server and client program that can send and recieve messages via type in the terminal
    ./chat -s <port> -p
    or
    ./chat -s <port> -p -q
    ./chat -c <ip> <port> -p <type> <param>
    or
    	(when using sudo make sure to try again after you insert the password!)

    sudo./chat -c <ip> <port> -p <type> <param> (for uds)
    to test it on your own computer, open two terminals and run the server on one and the client on the other
    choose a port number between 1024 and 65535
    and ip address 127.0.0.1,but when using ipv6 you need to use the ipv6 address of your computer
    that is ::1 as the ip address
    type is the type of message you want to send:
    ipv4,ipv6,uds,mmap,pipe
    param is the parameter for the message you want to send:
    tcp,udp,dgram,stream,filename

    the combination are:
    ipv4 tcp
    ipv4 udp
    ipv6 tcp
    ipv6 udp
    uds stream
    uds dgram
    mmap filename
    pipe filename
    remember: if you want to use ipv6, you need to use the ipv6 address of your computer
