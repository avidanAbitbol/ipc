compile the code and run the program:
    cmd->make all

part A:
make a server and client program that can send and recieve messages from each other
    ./chat -s <port>
    ./chat -c <ip> <port>
    to test it on your own computer, open two terminals and run the server on one and the client on the other
    choose a port number between 1024 and 65535
    and ip address 127.0.0.1
part B:
make a server and client program that can send and recieve messages via type in the terminal
    ./chat -s <port> -p
    or
    ./chat -s <port> -p -q
    ./chat -c <ip> <port> -p <type> <param>
    or
    sudo./chat -c <ip> <port> -p <type> <param> (for uds)
    to test it on your own computer, open two terminals and run the server on one and the client on the other
    choose a port number between 1024 and 65535
    and ip address 127.0.0.1,but when using ipv6 you need to use the ipv6 address of your computer
    that is ::1 as the ip address
    type is the type of message you want to send:
    ipv4,ipv6,uds,mmap,pipe
    param is the parameter for the message you want to send:
    tcp,udp,dgram,stream,filename

    the combination are:
    ipv4 tcp
    ipv4 udp
    ipv6 tcp
    ipv6 udp
    uds stream
    uds dgram
    mmap filename
    pipe filename
    remember: if you want to use ipv6, you need to use the ipv6 address of your computer
